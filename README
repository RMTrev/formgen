HTML Form Generation Utility
Trevor "RM_Trev" Daniels

This script was written to speed up the development of web-based forms,
while simultaneously reducing the amount of HTML mixed in with PHP.  The
script recognizes the following form constructs:

 - form: Top level form element
 - text: Basic single line text field
 - textarea: Multi-line text box
 - password: Same as text, except the characters are masked
 - radio: Set of radio buttons
 - check: Set of check boxes
 - menu: Select menu
 - optgroup: Option group, for use with select menus
 - file: File field
 - fieldset: Groups a set of fields.  Can use a legend to describe the set.
 - msg: Plain text message
 - placeholder: Element set aside for use with client-side scripting.

When a form is generated, it constructs the form as an unordered list, with
each of the above constructs placed inside list elements.

Each construct except for "form" has a css method, which allows the user to
apply CSS classes to that construct.  The "fieldset" construct has a legend
method, which sets the fieldset's legend to the string given.

Here is a usage example:

// Generate the form object.
$form = f("form");

// Generate a fieldset for contact information
$contact = f("fieldset")->legend("Contact Information");
$name = f("text","name")->label("Name")->css("textbox");
$address = f("text","address")->label("Address")->css("textbox");
$phone = f("text","phone")->label("Phone Number")->css("textbox");
// Add the fields to the fieldset
$contact->add($name)->add($address)->add($phone);
// Add the fieldset to the form
$form->add($contact);

// Generate a set of radio buttons with "Foo" and "Bar"
$rads = f("radio","rads")->label("Foo Bar?")->css("radio")
  ->opt(1,"Foo")
  ->opt(2,"Bar");
// Add the radio buttons to the form
$form->add($rads);

// Generate the form and print on the page
echo $form->out();
